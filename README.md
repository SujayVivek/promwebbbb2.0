# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##For start working on the project 

Kindly clone the repository to your system 
by writing the following command

git clone https://github.com/Spring-Fest/Promweb.git


###How to create a new Branch

git checkout <name_of_branch>  

write doen the name of branch you want to create 

To work on any specific branch write the command in the git bash terminal
List all branches

git branch -a 

Checkout the branch that you want

git checkout <name_of_branch>

if you guys want to clone any particular branch of the repository and prevent cloning the other branches you can use the following command

git clone -b branch_name --single-branch https://github.com/Spring-Fest/Promweb.git

###Replace the branch_name with the branch that you want to clone and work on it




##Before running the npm start command
write npm install in the root directory of the project to download all the packages.
The node _modules packges has not been uploaded in this repository


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
